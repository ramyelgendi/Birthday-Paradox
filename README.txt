Description of the Assignment:
  Q1. The user is prompted to run several experiments on one given set
      (with a specified range). The program then randomly draws numbers
      out of this set and count those draws until a number is drawn twice.
  Q2. Repeats the same logic of question 1, but with a series of ranges.
  Q3. The implementation of both Q1 and Q2, while using jfreechart to plot the
      mean and standard deviation.

      ** NOTE: the implementation of Q3 is as follows, the user is
      first prompted with a ** mode ** integer that will choose which question
      to ask and plot.
      --> Please note that the library of jfreechart needs to be re-edited into
          the project with the right path.
