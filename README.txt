Description
-------------
    * Question 1 - The user will pass 2 integers in the command line (range & number of runs). If nothing is passed or only range is passed, the default values will be applied.
    After that, the mean, number of experiments, standard deviation, min and max will be displayed for this specified range only.

    * Question 2 - User will pass 3 integers in the command line (range begin and end, and number of runs). If nothing is passed, default values are applied.
    After that, the step is calculated and for every step, the experiments will run for the current range, until it reaches the range end value.
    The mean, number of experiments, standard deviation, min and max will be displayed for every range.

    * Question 3 - There are 3 cases: Passing 2 integers in command line -> Question 1 will run, and results are plotted on a graph.
                                    Passing 3 integers in command line -> Question 2 will run and results are plotted on a graph.
                                    Passing any other number of integers, or not passing anything the user will be prompted to either pick to run one of the questions or terminate the program.

    * Note: All user inputs, and command line arguments are validated.
